# Software Requirements Specification

This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for the NMS Optimizer Service.

## 1. Functional Requirements

### 1.1. Optimization

*   **FR-1.1**: The system shall accept a user-defined grid layout, a set of technology modules, and a target technology as input.
*   **FR-1.2**: The system shall calculate the optimal placement of the given technology modules on the grid to maximize the adjacency bonus.
*   **FR-1.3**: The system shall take into account supercharged slots and their bonus multiplier when calculating the optimal placement.
*   **FR-1.4**: The system shall support all ship and multi-tool types available in the game "No Man's Sky".
*   **FR-1.5**: The system shall support all technology modules available in the game "No Man's Sky".
*   **FR-1.6**: The system shall provide the optimized grid layout, the calculated performance bonus, and the method used to find the solution as output.

### 1.2. User Interface

*   **FR-2.1**: The system shall provide an interactive grid editor that allows users to create and modify their grid layouts.
*   **FR-2.2**: The system shall provide a list of all available ship and multi-tool types for the user to choose from.
*   **FR-2.3**: The system shall provide a list of all available technology modules for the user to choose from.
*   **FR-2.4**: The system shall display the optimization results in a clear and easy-to-understand format.
*   **FR-2.5**: The system shall provide real-time progress updates to the user during the optimization process via a WebSocket connection.

### 1.3. Analytics

*   **FR-3.1**: The system shall collect anonymous data on the most popular ship and technology combinations.
*   **FR-3.2**: The system shall provide an endpoint to retrieve the collected analytics data.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

### 2.1. Performance

*   **NFR-1.1**: The system shall return an optimization result within 10 seconds for most common use cases.
*   **NFR-1.2**: The system shall be able to handle at least 10 concurrent optimization requests.

### 2.2. Scalability

*   **NFR-2.1**: The system shall be scalable to handle an increase in the number of users and optimization requests.

### 2.3. Reliability

*   **NFR-3.1**: The system shall be available 99.9% of the time.
*   **NFR-3.2**: The system shall gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful error messages to the user.

### 2.4. Usability

*   **NFR-4.1**: The user interface shall be intuitive and easy to use, even for non-technical users.

### 2.5. Maintainability

*   **NFR-5.1**: The code shall be well-documented and easy to maintain.
*   **NFR-5.2**: The project shall include a suite of automated tests to ensure the correctness of the optimization logic.
